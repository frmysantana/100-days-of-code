### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued my tribute page about Leonhard Euler on CodePen.io for FreeCodeCamp.com. Since it's been a while, I mostly refreshed my mind on the code, revised a few things, moved some code around now that I have a better understanding of CSS and experimented a bit using JQuery.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get back into a project, even if most of the time was spend reminding myself of how the code worked, and what ways I could change the page.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to include MathJax into my tribute page. During the process I also improved the structure of the HTML to make the code more readable and simplified the code while retaining the same appearance (removing unnecessary CSS that only italicized and bolded elements, and replaced those with emphasis and bold elements). I also read a bit about jQuery to see if there was some way to incorporate it into the page, but I don't think so. Which means that I'll now go deeper into playing with CSS before I submit the project.

**Thoughts**: I was surprised at how easy it was to incororate MathJax. When I found out about it yesterday, I though it would have taken me an hour to figure out how to use. However, it only actually took about 15 minutes!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (accidentally overwritten with the progress of the third day) 

### Day 3: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read through many different CSS options and tinkered with the CSS on my tribute page. Also I was unkowingly working on the copy of that tribute that I had saved for day 2, so that page is now lost.

**Thoughts**: Without having a clear design on paper or in my head, it's like I'm throwing paint at a wall and cleaning up what I don't like. However, I'm leaning towards seeing that as a positive, at least for now.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (after I finished the tribute page, I ended up deleting this version)

### Day 4: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I tried out JavaScript30.com and started doing the first challenge (a JS drum kit).

**Thoughts**: I've never used Javascript and only learned up to half way through FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented and Functional Programming section, so this project is a bit over my head, but I think I remember enough of the fundamentals to follow along with what is being done. However, I absolutely would not be able to do this from scratch, so I have a lot to dig into and refresh in order to continue.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JS drum kit challenge.

**Thoughts**: I CAN FINALLY BLAST BEAT!!!! It made me smile when I got the final product working!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the second Javascript30 challenge. However, instead of following the video, I only saw enough to understand what the final product should do. Then, I tried to reason what steps/tasks would have to be done to complete it, and then how these tasks could be done through code. Consequently, I was mostly reading Javascript and CSS documentation and tinkereing with pieces of code.

**Thoughts**: I felt very nervous trying to figure this out on my own without a guide, but I have to get used to and embrace this feeling if I'm going to make any significant progress in coding.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the second Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**: I caved and had to just use the video, making me realize that I don't understand this stuff very well.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the third Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**: Although I tried to piece it together on my own, I again had to just follow the video. I have to study this stuff more, especially now that these challenges have introduced me to many new concepts.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the fourth Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**:I was finally able to piece together some of the exercise on my own!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 10: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the fourth Javascript30 challenge. It's taking me a bit longer because I'm reading about and tinkering with the indicated methods, instead of watching the videos and copying Bos's approach.

**Thoughts**: It is much more rewarding to figure this out by myself.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 11: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the fourth Javascript30 challenge. However, I caved and had to just watch the video after only being able to solve the first 3 part of the challenge.

**Thoughts**: It felt a bit overwhelming, but I pulled through.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 1: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After several days of doing other forms of coding that weren't working on projects, I decided it would be best to start the challenge all over from day 1. Today I finished the tribute page for freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: It feels great to finally finish this thing!!!!!

### Day 2: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I began working on my portfolio page as part of FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: As I started laying the foundation for the page, I started realizing what challenges lay ahead in order to complete this project, such as putting a small image of a project in the portfolio section and using javascript to link to other sections of the page. However, these challenges made me excited to figure out instead of making me feel overwhelmed!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 3: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued the portfolio page. I drew a quick outline of the page and started putting in the buttons to skip around on the page, as well as the social media links.

**Thoughts**: I need a more thorough reference for Bootstrap.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 4: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued on the portfolio page. Figured out how to make bookmark links, as well as outlining all elements to more clearly see where everything is currently positioned.

**Thoughts**: I wasn't very distracted while working today and was surprised when the hour had already concluded.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 5: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished most of the layout and function of the portfolio page, including having a thumbnail of previous projects. However, the only previous project I have is the tribute page, for which I was able to use the embed feature on codepen.io. Not sure how I'm going to put thumbnails for future projects that aren't on codepen without holding the images locally on my computer.

**Thoughts**: N/A
