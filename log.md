### Day 1: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Inventory Update script challenge on freeCodeCamp. For the foreseeable future, I will be focusing my 100DaysOfCode time to completing the Front-End Certificate on freeCodeCamp. There are 4 more advanced algorithms left, the portfolio project that I never submitted, and finally the 4 advanced projects.

**Thoughts**: The challenge was relatively easy. The only problem that I kept running into was that I had unknowingly passed one of the inventory arrays by reference to another variable. This caused the original array to be modified whenever I changed that variable, which then interferred with the for loops that I had set up to compare the two inventories.

### Day 2: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I began the "No Repeats Please" script challenge on freeCodeCamp. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete it by the end of the day, although my attempt is right for 6 out of the 9 test strings.

**Thoughts**: I was first intimidated by the thought of trying to find all permutations of a string for the challenge, but was able to reason my way through it. However, my methodology was off as shown by the script failing for all strings longer than 3 characters. I was able to figure out that my algorithm wasn't comprehensive and found out how I could get all permutations on paper by thinking of each character as a node in a tree. However, I'm not sure how to get a computer to do this for me.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to comlete the "No Repeats Please" script Challenge by researching permutation algorithms and implementing Heap's algorithm. I don't actually understand the algorithm, but it did its job.

**Thoughts**: I feel uncomfortable about implementing an algorithm that I don't actually understand.

### Day 4: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Make a Person" script challenge on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It took me longer than expected because I misunderstood whether or not closures can be used to reset hard-coded variable values, but I eventually got it.

### Day 5: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Map the Debris" and "Pairwise" challenges on freeCodeCamp, thus finishing the Advanced Algorithms section. I also worked a bit on my portfolio design.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to be moving on to the advanced projects.

### Day 6: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Javascript Calculator project on freeCodeCamp. I completed the HTML and basic styling so that the page can be interpreted as a rudimentary calculator. I also set up the click event listeners on all of the elements and will be focusing the next day(s) to getting the page to be functional before I worry about better styling.

**Thoughts**: The initial anxiety I felt over not being sure how I'd complete this project gave way to excited experimentation as I started to code up the page. Felt great!

### Day 7: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed most of the functionality of the Javascript Calculator so that it compies with the freeCodeCamp User Stories. I may add in an oposite button (a button that returns the opposite sign of the last argument so that a positive number is returned as its negative and vice versa) some time in the future.

**Thoughts**: It felt great tackling this problem on the Javascript side and boosted my confidence that I do enjoy doing these sorts of things.

### Day 8: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I tried adding in some styling. I also wanted to change the layout of the top row of buttons and decided to add a button in order to move the '/' operation to the top row. However, the layout is now just off.

**Thoughts**: This made me realize that I've been spending so much time in JavaScript that my CSS is getting a bit too poor for my liking.

### Day 9: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the layout and styling issues and set up an event listener on the +/- button. Tomorrow I'll get it working, simplify the code, and add comments. By then the project should pretty much be done. 

**Thoughts**: I underestimated my CSS knowledge, for it actually didn't take that long to figure out the issues and fix them. I guess I was just a bit too tired last night to think straight.

### Day 10: January 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday was very hectic and busy, so I took a day off from coding. Today I finished the functionality of the Javascript Calculator and simplified and commented the code.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling a bit tired, but happy that I have essentially finished this project. For the next few days, I'm going to focus on my portfolio site.

### Day 11: January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started coding my portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: I didn't start this until late in the day, so my brain was a bit foggy. As a result, I was a bit slow. Thankfully, slow and steady can still win the race.

### Day 12: January 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with my website. I'm mainly trying to get the site to match the mobile design. Then I will match the desktop design and finally add the functionality.

**Thoughts**: I felt okay with the work I did today. It's some more progress. However, I may have to devote more than an hour per day to this later in the week if I'm going to have it completed by Sunday.

### Day 13: January 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the code for the mobile version, I think. I write "I think", because so far I've only been testing the output on the browser on my laptop and changing the window size to what Bootstrap considers mobile size (less than 768 px). In a little bit, I'll check if it works on mobile. Tomorrow I'll do the tablet-and-up design (which is the desktop design), thus leaving me 2-3 days to flesh out the functionality and content.

Update: I just looked at the HTML preview of my site on mobile, and the layout worked!

**Thoughts**: I feel great (albiet pretty tired) for making steady progress on this!

### Day 14: January 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I just about finished all the styling for the tablet-and-up versions. Now I have to add the functionality and content.

**Thoughts**: Tired but satisfied with my progress.

### Day 15: January 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I was mainly trying to get the contact form at the end of the page to be working. Not sure if it does, but I think it's time I move onto putting the rest of the functionality to the project images.

**Thoughts**: I think this feature may have to be added to a future version of my site, for I just started to realize that I would probabaly need to do some sort of validating and other security precautions that I don't know of right now.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A. I forgot to update github the day that I did this, so my code has changes reflecting other features.

### Day 16: January 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was trying to confiure my desktop to have wordpress so that I could start learning that. Unfortunately, after getting Flywheel and trying to setup a default site to make sure that it is working, the page could not load. I'll have to troubleshoot this another time.

**Thoughts**: I feel a bit frustrated that Flywheel gave me a few issues, but that's probably a common theme in IT/Software Development, so I just have to become accustomed to this.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A.

### Day 17: January 21, 2018

**Today's Prgress**: I went back to my portfolio and played with jQuery to see if I can make each project image display a short description when the user clicks on it. I made some progress, but it's not complete yet, so I'll continue it tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Once again, it feels strangely relaxing to work on this stuff, even if I don't completely figure something out in the timespace I had planned to.

These updates also show the stuff I added to the form section when I was trying to get it to work.

### Day 18: January 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I improved the toggle feature on the portfolio. Now the other projects at least return once the selected project is clicked on again. I also added mock project descriptions onto the other projects, and dead links that will take the user to the htmlpreview version of the project once the final content is up. I have to find a way to store the original classes of each project so that the toggle feature returns the images to their original styling. Then I have to get the feature to work on mobile and find a way to choose the right code depending on the viewport width.

**Thoughts**: At first I felt pretty overwhelmed and lost, but by the end I felt pretty good about my chances to finish this portfolio page.

### Day 19: January 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: The toggle feature now works on both tablet-and-up and mobile versions. I also hid the labels from appearing on the page, since the original design has the labels inside the inputs. Lastly, I began ordering the CSS declarations, adding comments, and changing some of the names to be more descriptive.

**Thoughts**: After writing the progress that I made, I'm surprised that I was able to do this much in just an hour.

### Day 20: January 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added some transitions/jQuery animations so that the changes in layout when selecting/unselecting a project aren't instantaneous. However, it has led to a bug where changes in one layout may effect the other layout if one changes the screen size before setting everything back to normal.

**Thoughts**: I at first thought that adding animations/transitions would be too hard for me right now, but it didn't actually take that long. While the animations don't look that good (especially when selecting a project from the right column on the tablet-and-up layout), I feel that it still makes the page better, so I'm sticking with them. When I learn CSS animations in more depth, I'll definitely come back to this to improve them.

### Day 21: January 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started adding in the final content to my portfolio. In order to do this, however, I also had to fix/take note of several issues on some of the projects that I wanted to put on it. I also was trying to fix the issue with changes in one layout breaking the other layout, but wasn't able to make much progress.

**Thoughts**: After being contacted by an employer that I applied to last week, I am far more motivated to complete this portfolio, so I feel confident that I'll get past these hurdles I'm currently facing.

### Day 22: January 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to use MediaQueryList to get my portfolio to reload whenever the viewport crosses the 768px width boundary. This at least gets around the layout issue I struggled with yesterday. I also decided to get rid of the form element, as it didn't actually work. I'll add in a working form element as part of the next version of my site.

**Thoughts**: I feel really happy that I was able to get around this layout problem.

**Link(s) to work**: See tomorrow's links, for I forgot to update GitHub before continuing to change the code.

### Day 23: January 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I reorganized the project layout on the page so that it is easier to add projects in the future. I also finished alphabetizing the selectors and declarations in the styles.css file. Finally, I continued adding to the project descriptions.

**Thoughts**: I didn't feel like doing anything today, but I reminded myself that days like today are the most important when it comes to establishing a habit, thus willing myself to do at least some coding. To be frank, I think it was only about 45 minutes instead of the full hour, but at least it is something.
