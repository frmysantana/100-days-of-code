### Day 1: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Inventory Update script challenge on freeCodeCamp. For the foreseeable future, I will be focusing my 100DaysOfCode time to completing the Front-End Certificate on freeCodeCamp. There are 4 more advanced algorithms left, the portfolio project that I never submitted, and finally the 4 advanced projects.

**Thoughts**: The challenge was relatively easy. The only problem that I kept running into was that I had unknowingly passed one of the inventory arrays by reference to another variable. This caused the original array to be modified whenever I changed that variable, which then interferred with the for loops that I had set up to compare the two inventories.

### Day 2: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I began the "No Repeats Please" script challenge on freeCodeCamp. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete it by the end of the day, although my attempt is right for 6 out of the 9 test strings.

**Thoughts**: I was first intimidated by the thought of trying to find all permutations of a string for the challenge, but was able to reason my way through it. However, my methodology was off as shown by the script failing for all strings longer than 3 characters. I was able to figure out that my algorithm wasn't comprehensive and found out how I could get all permutations on paper by thinking of each character as a node in a tree. However, I'm not sure how to get a computer to do this for me.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to comlete the "No Repeats Please" script Challenge by researching permutation algorithms and implementing Heap's algorithm. I don't actually understand the algorithm, but it did its job.

**Thoughts**: I feel uncomfortable about implementing an algorithm that I don't actually understand.

### Day 4: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Make a Person" script challenge on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It took me longer than expected because I misunderstood whether or not closures can be used to reset hard-coded variable values, but I eventually got it.

### Day 5: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Map the Debris" and "Pairwise" challenges on freeCodeCamp, thus finishing the Advanced Algorithms section. I also worked a bit on my portfolio design.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to be moving on to the advanced projects.

### Day 6: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Javascript Calculator project on freeCodeCamp. I completed the HTML and basic styling so that the page can be interpreted as a rudimentary calculator. I also set up the click event listeners on all of the elements and will be focusing the next day(s) to getting the page to be functional before I worry about better styling.

**Thoughts**: The initial anxiety I felt over not being sure how I'd complete this project gave way to excited experimentation as I started to code up the page. Felt great!

### Day 7: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed most of the functionality of the Javascript Calculator so that it compies with the freeCodeCamp User Stories. I may add in an oposite button (a button that returns the opposite sign of the last argument so that a positive number is returned as its negative and vice versa) some time in the future.

**Thoughts**: It felt great tackling this problem on the Javascript side and boosted my confidence that I do enjoy doing these sorts of things.

### Day 8: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I tried adding in some styling. I also wanted to change the layout of the top row of buttons and decided to add a button in order to move the '/' operation to the top row. However, the layout is now just off.

**Thoughts**: This made me realize that I've been spending so much time in JavaScript that my CSS is getting a bit too poor for my liking.

### Day 9: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I fixed the layout and styling issues and set up an event listener on the +/- button. Tomorrow I'll get it working, simplify the code, and add comments. By then the project should pretty much be done. 

**Thoughts**: I underestimated my CSS knowledge, for it actually didn't take that long to figure out the issues and fix them. I guess I was just a bit too tired last night to think straight.

### Day 10: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Yesterday was very hectic and busy, so I took a day off from coding. Today I finished the functionality of the Javascript Calculator and simplified and commented the code.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling a bit tired, but happy that I have essentially finished this project. For the next few days, I'm going to focus on my portfolio site.

### Day 11: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I started coding my portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: I didn't start this until late in the day, so my brain was a bit foggy. As a result, I was a bit slow. Thankfully, slow and steady can still win the race.

### Day 12: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with my website. I'm mainly trying to get the site to match the mobile design. Then I will match the desktop design and finally add the functionality.

**Thoughts**: I felt okay with the work I did today. It's some more progress. However, I may have to devote more than an hour per day to this later in the week if I'm going to have it completed by Sunday.

### Day 13: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished the code for the mobile version, I think. I write "I think", because so far I've only been testing the output on the browser on my laptop and changing the window size to what Bootstrap considers mobile size (less than 768 px). In a little bit, I'll check if it works on mobile. Tomorrow I'll do the tablet-and-up design (which is the desktop design), thus leaving me 2-3 days to flesh out the functionality and content.

**Thoughts**: I feel great (albiet pretty tired) for making steady progress on this!
