### Day 1: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Inventory Update script challenge on freeCodeCamp. For the foreseeable future, I will be focusing my 100DaysOfCode time to completing the Front-End Certificate on freeCodeCamp. There are 4 more advanced algorithms left, the portfolio project that I never submitted, and finally the 4 advanced projects.

**Thoughts**: The challenge was relatively easy. The only problem that I kept running into was that I had unknowingly passed one of the inventory arrays by reference to another variable. This caused the original array to be modified whenever I changed that variable, which then interferred with the for loops that I had set up to compare the two inventories.
