### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued my tribute page about Leonhard Euler on CodePen.io for FreeCodeCamp.com. Since it's been a while, I mostly refreshed my mind on the code, revised a few things, moved some code around now that I have a better understanding of CSS and experimented a bit using JQuery.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get back into a project, even if most of the time was spend reminding myself of how the code worked, and what ways I could change the page.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to include MathJax into my tribute page. During the process I also improved the structure of the HTML to make the code more readable and simplified the code while retaining the same appearance (removing unnecessary CSS that only italicized and bolded elements, and replaced those with emphasis and bold elements). I also read a bit about jQuery to see if there was some way to incorporate it into the page, but I don't think so. Which means that I'll now go deeper into playing with CSS before I submit the project.

**Thoughts**: I was surprised at how easy it was to incororate MathJax. When I found out about it yesterday, I though it would have taken me an hour to figure out how to use. However, it only actually took about 15 minutes!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (accidentally overwritten with the progress of the third day) 

### Day 3: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read through many different CSS options and tinkered with the CSS on my tribute page. Also I was unkowingly working on the copy of that tribute that I had saved for day 2, so that page is now lost.

**Thoughts**: Without having a clear design on paper or in my head, it's like I'm throwing paint at a wall and cleaning up what I don't like. However, I'm leaning towards seeing that as a positive, at least for now.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A (after I finished the tribute page, I ended up deleting this version)

### Day 4: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I tried out JavaScript30.com and started doing the first challenge (a JS drum kit).

**Thoughts**: I've never used Javascript and only learned up to half way through FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented and Functional Programming section, so this project is a bit over my head, but I think I remember enough of the fundamentals to follow along with what is being done. However, I absolutely would not be able to do this from scratch, so I have a lot to dig into and refresh in order to continue.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JS drum kit challenge.

**Thoughts**: I CAN FINALLY BLAST BEAT!!!! It made me smile when I got the final product working!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the second Javascript30 challenge. However, instead of following the video, I only saw enough to understand what the final product should do. Then, I tried to reason what steps/tasks would have to be done to complete it, and then how these tasks could be done through code. Consequently, I was mostly reading Javascript and CSS documentation and tinkereing with pieces of code.

**Thoughts**: I felt very nervous trying to figure this out on my own without a guide, but I have to get used to and embrace this feeling if I'm going to make any significant progress in coding.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the second Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**: I caved and had to just use the video, making me realize that I don't understand this stuff very well.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the third Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**: Although I tried to piece it together on my own, I again had to just follow the video. I have to study this stuff more, especially now that these challenges have introduced me to many new concepts.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 9: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the fourth Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**:I was finally able to piece together some of the exercise on my own!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 10: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the fourth Javascript30 challenge. It's taking me a bit longer because I'm reading about and tinkering with the indicated methods, instead of watching the videos and copying Bos's approach.

**Thoughts**: It is much more rewarding to figure this out by myself.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 11: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the fourth Javascript30 challenge. However, I caved and had to just watch the video after only being able to solve the first 3 part of the challenge.

**Thoughts**: It felt a bit overwhelming, but I pulled through.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 1: January 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After several days of doing other forms of coding that weren't working on projects, I decided it would be best to start the challenge all over from day 1. Today I finished the tribute page for freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: It feels great to finally finish this thing!!!!!

**Link(s) to work**: http://codepen.io/frmysantana/pen/ZOXqqQ

### Day 2: January 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I began working on my portfolio page as part of FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: As I started laying the foundation for the page, I started realizing what challenges lay ahead in order to complete this project, such as putting a small image of a project in the portfolio section and using javascript to link to other sections of the page. However, these challenges made me excited to figure out instead of making me feel overwhelmed!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 3: January 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued the portfolio page. I drew a quick outline of the page and started putting in the buttons to skip around on the page, as well as the social media links.

**Thoughts**: I need a more thorough reference for Bootstrap.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 4: January 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued on the portfolio page. Figured out how to make bookmark links, as well as outlining all elements to more clearly see where everything is currently positioned.

**Thoughts**: I wasn't very distracted while working today and was surprised when the hour had already concluded.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 5: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished most of the layout and function of the portfolio page, including having a thumbnail of previous projects. However, the only previous project I have is the tribute page, for which I was able to use the embed feature on codepen.io. Not sure how I'm going to put thumbnails for future projects that aren't on codepen without holding the images locally on my computer.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 6: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played with some visual aspects of the portfolio page, including using font-awesome. Along the way I was reading about hidden attributes.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm running out of steam to keep fueling this project. I may have to end it soon so that I reinvigorate myself with something new.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 7: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the algorithm challenges on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 8: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Algorithms!

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 9: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Even more algorithms. Just four left before I finish this section on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 10: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting section of FreeCodeCamp!

**Thoughts**: The last challenge of this section (Caeser's Cipher) was particularly challenging, but after I completed it, I felt very accomplished! 

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 11: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started and completed FreeCodeCamp's "JSON APIs and Ajax" section. Tomorrow I will begin the intermediate front-end projects.

**Thoughts**: I liked that this section actually showed how javascript/jquery can effect the appearance of a page, as well as shedding light on the concept of APIs, a term which I have heard of several times by now, but never really had an idea of what they were.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 12: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began the random quote machine project today. Mostly just put some basic html and css and start having a foundation for the project. I also experimented a bit with jquery and goodreads.com to see if I could import their quotes to my page easily. Did not work! But they have an API that I'll try to use for the project.

**Thoughts**: As I started realizing the scope of the project, it became very daunting to me and I started to get anxious. But I realized this is probably how I'll feel starting every project, so I have to get used to it and continue working on the project regardless.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 13: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Decided that instead of tinkering with the goodreads API, I could try to build a prototype as a proof of concept. So I gathered five quotes and was eventually able to get JQuery to update the displayed text with a randomly selected quote. Next I have to try to get JQuery to also update the color of the page randomly through CSS variables.

**Thoughts**: It felt great to unravel this puzzle!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 14: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've tried many approaches and am reading into CSS to try to figure out how to update my CSS variable that is controlling the colors on the page, but couldn't figure it out today.

**Thoughts**: Although I haven't figured it out, I still have some hunches, so I'm not feeling bad about today's work.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 15: February 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: After adapting some code that I found on stackoverflow, JQuery finally updates the variables! However, I'm not sure why this approach works while the approach that I was trying did not work (the only difference between the two is that the stackoverflow solution uses .get(0) on the selector before trying to update the style, but from reading about this method, it doesn't yet make sense to me as the selector that I used only has one instance within the HTML code, not several).

**Thoughts**: A bit mystified as to why the solution works, but nonetheless I feel good that I finally have a solution.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 16: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued trying to find a way to get the tweet button to work. Found a promising link that I may be able to use as a template in order to figure this out.

**Thoughts**: No highs today. But also no lows!!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 17: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got a bit closer to getting the tweet button to work, but it's still not there yet.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 18: February 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Tweet button works!!!

**Thoughts**: I got that satisfied feeling again once all of the functional features were completed!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 19: February 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Changed a bunch of the CSS on the quote machine so that the quotes were readable regardless of what random color they are set to. I did this by using the text-shadow property with blur. I also brought in font awesome to make the buttons look better and found a way to make the content be vertically centered. All that is left is to include some javascript that filters quotes that are too long for twitter, understand the parts of this code that I only slightly modified and got to work without really understanding how or why they work, and getting more quotes. At this point, I don't think that goodreads is the way to go to complete this aspect of the project.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good, especially now that I'm seeing more of what CSS can do.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 20: February 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied the text-shadow property that I used for the quote machine and started trying to understand the code that vertically centered the output box.

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 21: February 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I think I know have an okay understanding of how the vertical centering works.

**Thoughts**: Each little aspect that I learn opens up a whole new level of depth to CSS. It's kind of daunting, but I'll persevere.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 22: February 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Now I'm trying to understand how the javascript I borrowed achieved the desired results, and why my previous attempts hadn't worked. I now understand how the tweet button works through the jQuery code that I added.

**Thoughts**: I will still have to add a filter to make sure that the entire quote, along with the speaker, totals less than 140 characters in order for the tweet button to still work.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 23: February 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I now think I understand how the code I added to change the color CSS variable when the next quote button is clicked works, as well as why my original approach did not work.

**Thoughts**: Just as with CSS, this new understanding has revealed a new level of complexity within jQuery, as well as leading me to use codepen's feature of creating a downloadable .zip file with the fully formatted webpage code in case you need the browser's developer tools to continue refining your project. This is getting increasingly more interesting!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 24: February 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added a Google font to make the quotes look nicer. I also added more quotes to choose from. Now I have to filter through them to only keep the ones that would fit on twitter.

**Thoughts**: Almost didn't work on code today, but I made myself get it done. However, it wasn't an hour (more like 40 minutes).

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 25: February 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added some more quotes and filtered through them to see which were short enough to tweet. I think at this point the project is completed!

**Thoughts**: Feels good to see this project through to the end!

### Day 26: February 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day going through database stuff on Udacity.

**Thoughts**: Irregularity with this topic is partly why it's taking me so long to finish this program.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 27: February 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the database lesson on Udacity from yesterday. Now I'm not sure if I'll go straight into the Udacity project, or work on my flash card project. I think I'll prioritise the udacity project and work on my flashcard thing on the side.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 28: February 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I decided to focus on the udacity project to finish the nanadegree ASAP. Today I mainly was going through a bunch of the links that the database lessons led me to.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 29: February 27

**Today's Progress**: Started the database project for Udacity. Not sure how I'll structure some of the tables, but I have a decent idea about structuring the players and their standings. Also completed a few of the functions on the python DB API side.

**Thoughts**: Today I started implementing the pomodoro technique, although I only did one round. Completed it successfully without any issues. Hopefully this helps me ramp up my productivity.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 30: March 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started running unit tests on the functions. There are many errors to correct.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 31: March 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got through the first round of unit tests and am working on the next function.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 32: March 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on that aformentioned function. Trying to find a way to sum rows instead of columns.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 33: March 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I decided to change the database schema instead of continuing down that row-wise sum idea. Also passed the next round of unit tests and started on the last function.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 34: March 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the functions and schema! They now pass all of the tests. I may have to refactor some of it so that it used python less and I definitely have to add documentation, but I think I can have everything done by tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 35: March 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished and submitted the database project!

**Thoughts**: Feels great to accomplish another project!

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 36: March 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got feedback on the database project and worked on improving it. I added a matches table to keep track of specific matches along with their winners and added some views to simplify to sql queries. Now to see if I can simplify the connect, cursor, execute, commit, close process and create/connect to the database from within the tournament.sql file.

**Thoughts**:N/A

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 37: March 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to do all of the connecting, cursoring, executing, commiting, fetching, and closing through just what was originally the "connect" function. However, the code wound up being longer and slower, I think. Not sure if this was worth it, but it was a good challenge to work through. Tomorrow I'll try to delete, create, and connect from the tournament.sql file. Regardless of whether or not I can figure that out, I will be resubmitting the project tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I had some more inertia than usual today when trying to code, but I got through it.

**Link(s) to work**: N/A

### Day 38: March 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was able to shorten the tournament.py file so that the new implementation (with all query executions done through one function) is shorter than the original. Not sure if it is faster, though. I also figured out how to delete, creat, and connect from the tournament.sql file and updated the README file accordingly. Now that it's done, I resubmitted the project.

**Thoughts**: Turns out the solution to the delete/create through sql was far simpler than I thought. I would have gotten the answer within five minutes if I just read the documentation on the DROP query.
