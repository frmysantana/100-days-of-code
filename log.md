### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued my tribute page about Leonhard Euler on CodePen.io for FreeCodeCamp.com. Since it's been a while, I mostly refreshed my mind on the code, revised a few things, moved some code around now that I have a better understanding of CSS and experimented a bit using JQuery.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get back into a project, even if most of the time was spend reminding myself of how the code worked, and what ways I could change the page.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to include MathJax into my tribute page. During the process I also improved the structure of the HTML to make the code more readable and simplified the code while retaining the same appearance (removing unnecessary CSS that only italicized and bolded elements, and replaced those with emphasis and bold elements). I also read a bit about jQuery to see if there was some way to incorporate it into the page, but I don't think so. Which means that I'll now go deeper into playing with CSS before I submit the project.

**Thoughts**: I was surprised at how easy it was to incororate MathJax. When I found out about it yesterday, I though it would have taken me an hour to figure out how to use. However, it only actually took about 15 minutes!

### Day 3: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read through many different CSS options and tinkered with the CSS on my tribute page. Also I was unkowingly working on the copy of that tribute that I had saved for day 2, so that page is now lost.

**Thoughts**: Without having a clear design on paper or in my head, it's like I'm throwing paint at a wall and cleaning up what I don't like. However, I'm leaning towards seeing that as a positive, at least for now.

### Day 4: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I tried out JavaScript30.com and started doing the first challenge (a JS drum kit).

**Thoughts**: I've never used Javascript and only learned up to half way through FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented and Functional Programming section, so this project is a bit over my head, but I think I remember enough of the fundamentals to follow along with what is being done. However, I absolutely would not be able to do this from scratch, so I have a lot to dig into and refresh in order to continue.

### Day 5: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the JS drum kit challenge.

**Thoughts**: I CAN FINALLY BLAST BEAT!!!! It made me smile when I got the final product working!

### Day 6: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the second Javascript30 challenge. However, instead of following the video, I only saw enough to understand what the final product should do. Then, I tried to reason what steps/tasks would have to be done to complete it, and then how these tasks could be done through code. Consequently, I was mostly reading Javascript and CSS documentation and tinkereing with pieces of code.

**Thoughts**: I felt very nervous trying to figure this out on my own without a guide, but I have to get used to and embrace this feeling if I'm going to make any significant progress in coding.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the second Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**: I caved and had to just use the video, making me realize that I don't understand this stuff very well.

### Day 8: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the third Javascript30 challenge.

**Thoughts**: Although I tried to piece it together on my own, I again had to just follow the video. I have to study this stuff more, especially now that these challenges have introduced me to many new concepts.
