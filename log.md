# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued my tribute page about Leonhard Euler on CodePen.io for FreeCodeCamp.com. Since it's been a while, I mostly refreshed my mind on the code, revised a few things, moved some code around now that I have a better understanding of CSS and experimented a bit using JQuery.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get back into a project, even if most of the time was spend reminding myself of how the code worked, and what ways I could change the page.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
