# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued my tribute page about Leonhard Euler on CodePen.io for FreeCodeCamp.com. Since it's been a while, I mostly refreshed my mind on the code, revised a few things, moved some code around now that I have a better understanding of CSS and experimented a bit using JQuery.

**Thoughts:** It felt good to get back into a project, even if most of the time was spend reminding myself of how the code worked, and what ways I could change the page.

### Day 2: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out how to include MathJax into my tribute page. During the process I also improved the structure of the HTML to make the code more readable and simplified the code while retaining the same appearance (removing unnecessary CSS that only italicized and bolded elements, and replaced those with emphasis and bold elements). I also read a bit about jQuery to see if there was some way to incorporate it into the page, but I don't think so. Which means that I'll now go deeper into playing with CSS before I submit the project.

**Thoughts**: I was surprised at how easy it was to incororate MathJax. When I found out about it yesterday, I though it would have taken me an hour to figure out how to use. However, it only actually took about 15 minutes!
