### Day 1: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the Inventory Update script challenge on freeCodeCamp. For the foreseeable future, I will be focusing my 100DaysOfCode time to completing the Front-End Certificate on freeCodeCamp. There are 4 more advanced algorithms left, the portfolio project that I never submitted, and finally the 4 advanced projects.

**Thoughts**: The challenge was relatively easy. The only problem that I kept running into was that I had unknowingly passed one of the inventory arrays by reference to another variable. This caused the original array to be modified whenever I changed that variable, which then interferred with the for loops that I had set up to compare the two inventories.

### Day 2: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I began the "No Repeats Please" script challenge on freeCodeCamp. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete it by the end of the day, although my attempt is right for 6 out of the 9 test strings.

**Thoughts**: I was first intimidated by the thought of trying to find all permutations of a string for the challenge, but was able to reason my way through it. However, my methodology was off as shown by the script failing for all strings longer than 3 characters. I was able to figure out that my algorithm wasn't comprehensive and found out how I could get all permutations on paper by thinking of each character as a node in a tree. However, I'm not sure how to get a computer to do this for me.

### Day 3: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I was able to comlete the "No Repeats Please" script Challenge by researching permutation algorithms and implementing Heap's algorithm. I don't actually understand the algorithm, but it did its job.

**Thoughts**: I feel uncomfortable about implementing an algorithm that I don't actually understand.

### Day 4: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Make a Person" script challenge on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It took me longer than expected because I misunderstood whether or not closures can be used to reset hard-coded variable values, but I eventually got it.

### Day 5: January 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed the "Map the Debris" and "Pairwise" challenges on freeCodeCamp, thus finishing the Advanced Algorithms section. I also worked a bit on my portfolio design.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to be moving on to the advanced projects.

### Day 6: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Javascript Calculator project on freeCodeCamp. I completed the HTML and basic styling so that the page can be interpreted as a rudimentary calculator. I also set up the click event listeners on all of the elements and will be focusing the next day(s) to getting the page to be functional before I worry about better styling.

**Thoughts**: The initial anxiety I felt over not being sure how I'd complete this project gave way to excited experimentation as I started to code up the page. Felt great!

### Day 7: January 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed most of the functionality of the Javascript Calculator so that it compies with the freeCodeCamp User Stories. I may add in an oposite button (a button that returns the opposite sign of the last argument so that a positive number is returned as its negative and vice versa) some time in the future.

**Thoughts**: It felt great tackling this problem on the Javascript side and boosted my confidence that I do enjoy doing these sorts of things.
